\section{Group}

A {\bf group}
$\calg$
is a set of elements
with a multiplication map $\calg\times \calg
\rarrow \calg$
such that


\begin{enumerate}
\item 
the multiplication is {\bf associative
}; i.e., 

\beq
(ab)c = a(bc)
\eeq
for $a,b,c\in\calg$.

\item
there exists an {\bf identity element}
$e\in \calg$
such that 

\beq
ea=ae=a
\eeq
for all $a\in \calg$

\item
for any $g\in\calg$,
there exists an {\bf inverse} $a^{-1}\in \calg$ such that

\beq
aa^{-1}=a^{-1}a=e
\eeq
\end{enumerate}

The number of elements in any set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$. 
$|\calg|$
is called the {\bf order}
of the group.

If multiplication is
{\bf commutative}
(i.e., $ab=ba$ for all $a,b\in\calg$,
the group is said to be {\bf abelian}.

A {\bf subgroup} $\calh$ 
of $\calg$
is a subset of $\calg$
($\calh \subset \calg$)
which is also a group.
It's easy to show that any $\calh\subset \calg$ is a group if it
contains the identity
and is {\bf closed 
under multiplication} (i.e., $ab\in \calh$ for all $a,b\in \calh$) 



\section{Group  Representation}

A {\bf group representation}
of a group $\calg$
is a map $\phi: \calg\rarrow \CC^{n\times n}$\footnote{More generally, the $\CC^{n\times n}$ can be replaced by $\RR^{n\times n}$ or by $\FF^{n\times n}$ for any field $\FF$} such that

\beq
\phi(a)\phi(b)=
\phi(ab)
\eeq
Such a map is called a {\bf homomorphism}.
When a group is 
defined using matrices, those
matrices are called the {\bf defining representation}.
The map $\phi$ 
partitions $\calg$
into disjoints subsets (equivalence classes),
such that all elements of $\calg$ in a disjoint set 
are represented by the same matrix.


For example,
the group
of {\bf General Linear Transformations}
is defined by

\beq
GL(n, \CC)=
\{M\in \CC^{n\times n}: \det{M}\neq 0\}
\eeq

\section{Vector Space and Algebra over a field $\FF$}

A vector (or linear)  space $\calv$
is defined as a set endowed with
two operations: vector addition $+:\calv\times\calv\rarrow \calv$,
and scalar multiplication $\FF\times\calv\rarrow \calv$,
such that

\begin{itemize}
\item $\calv$ is an abelian group under $+$
with identity $0$ and inverse of $x\in\calv$ equal to $-x\in\calv$

\item
For $\alp, \beta\in\FF$ and
$x,y\in\calv$
\beqa
\alp(x+y) &=& \alp x + \alp y
\\
(\alp +\beta)x &=& \alp x + \beta y
\\
\alp(\beta x)
&=&
(\alp\beta)x
\\
1x &=& x
\\
0x &=& 0
\eeqa
\end{itemize}
 In this book, we will always use either $\CC$ or $\RR$ for $\FF$. Both 
 of these fields are infinite but some fields are finite.


An {\bf algebra} $\cala$ is a
vector space  
which, 
besides being endowed with vector addition
and scalar multiplication
with which all vector spaces are,
it has
a {\bf bilinear vector product}.
A bilinear vector product is a product that is linear on both sides; i.e., 

\beq
(\alp x + \beta y)\cdot z =
\alp x\cdot z +
\beta y\cdot z
\eeq
and 
\beq
z\cdot(\alp x + \beta y)=
\alp z \cdot x +
\beta z\cdot y
\eeq
for $x,y, z\in \cala$ and 
$\alp, \beta\in\CC$.
The cross product (but not the dot product)
for vectors in $\RR^3$,
the multiplication of 2 complex numbers,
and the commutator for
square matrices, are all good examples of
bilinear vector products.

Let $B = \{\tau_i: i=1, 2, \ldots, r\}$
be a basis for the vector space $\cala$. 
Then note that
$B$ is closed under vector multiplication. 

\beq
\tau_i\cdot \tau_j=
\sum_k c\indices{_{ij}^k} \tau_k
\eeq
where $c\indices{_{ij}^k}\in\CC$.
The $c\indices{_{ij}^k}$ are called 
{\bf structure constants} of $B$.

An {\bf associative algebra} satisfies 
$(x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot(y\cdot z)$ for
$x,y,z\in \cala$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Not associative: cross product for vectors in  $\RR^3$.
\item Associative:
the commutator for square matrices and product of complex numbers
\end{itemize}

\section{Tensors}

$(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x^{:n}\in V^n=\CC^{n\times 1}$

Reverse of vector $rev(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)=
(x_n, x_{n-1},
\ldots, x_1)$

$y^b = \sum_b g^{ba}x^{:n}$

$(y^1, y^2, \ldots, y^n)= \bar{y}^{:n}\in \bar{V}^n=\CC^{n\times 1}$. $V^n$ and
$\bar{V}^n$ are {\bf dual vector spaces}.



$M\indices{_a^b}\in \CC^{n\times n}$, $a, b\in\ZZ_{[1,n]}$

Implicit Summation Convention

\beq
M\indices{_a^b}x_b = \sum_{b=1}^n
M\indices{_a^b}x_b
\eeq

\beqa
(M^\dagger)\indices{_b^a} &=& (M^*)\indices{_a^b}
\\
&=&
M\indices{_b^a}
\quad \text{(only if $M$ is a unitary matrix)}
\eeqa

For $x_a\in V^n$,

\beq
(x')_a = M\indices{_a^b} x_b
\eeq
For $x^a\in \bar{V}^{n}$, 



\beqa
(x'^*)^a &=& x^{*b} (M^*)\indices{^a_b}
\\
&=&
x^{*b} (M^\dagger)\indices{_b^a}
\eeqa
so

\beq
(M^\dagger)\indices{_b^a}=
(M^*)\indices{^a_b}
\eeq
If the Hermitian conjugate $\dagger$
equals $*T$ where $*$ is complex conjugation and $T$ is transpose,

\beq
(M^T)\indices{_b^a}= M\indices{^a_b}
\eeq
This corresponds to flipping $M$ 
along its horizontal.

Note that
for $x\in V^n{}$, $y\in \bar{V}^n$, and $G\in \calg\subset GL(n, \CC)$,

\beq

G\indices{_a^d}x_dy^c
\eeq


If $x\in V^{n^p}\otimes \bar{V}^{n^q}$, $\GG\in \calg\subset GL(n^{p+q}, \CC)$,

\beq

\beq

An issue that arises with tensors is this:
When is it permissible to represent 
a tensor by $T_{ab}^{cd}$?
If we define
$T_{ab}^{cd}$  by
\beq
T_{ab}^{cd} = T\indices{_a_b^c^d}
\eeq
then it's always permissible.
Then one can define
tensors like
$T\indices{_a^b^c^d}$
as 

\beq
T\indices{_a^b^c^d}=
g^{bb'}T\indices{_a_{b'}^c^d}
=
g^{bb'}T_{ab'}^{cd}
\eeq
Hence, one drawback of
using the notation
$T_{ab}^{cd}$
is that if one is interested 
in using versions of
$T_{ab}^{cd}$ with
some indices raised or 
lowered, one has to 
write down explicitly the metric tensors 
that do the lowering and
raising.
Instead of writing
$T\indices{_a^b^c^d}$,
you'll have to write
$g^{bb'}T_{ab'}^{cd}$.
This is not very onerous when 
explaining a topic
in which not much
lowering and raising of indices is
done. But in topics like
General Relativity that do
use a lot of raising and lowering of indices, it might not be 
too elegantly concise.
