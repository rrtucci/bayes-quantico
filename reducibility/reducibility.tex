\chapter{Reducibility of Representations}
\label{ch-reducibility}

This chapter is based on Cvitanovic's Birdtracks book Ref. \cite{birdtracks-book}.

\section{Eigenvalue Projectors}

Suppose $M\in \CC^{d\times d }$ 
has eigenvalues 
$\lam_i$ with corresponding eigenvectors $\ket{\lam_i}$

\beq
M\ket{\lam_i}=\lam_i \ket{\lam_i}
\eeq
for $i\in \ZZ_{[1,r]}$.
The characteristic polynomial of $M$ is
defined as

\beq
cp(\lam)\eqdef \det(M-\lam)= \prod_{i=1}^r (\lam-\lam_i)^{d_i}
\eeq
It satisfies

\beq
cp(\lam) =0
\eeq
for $\lam=\lam_i$.

Note 
that if $M$ is Hermitian 
($M^\dagger=M$),
then all its eigenvalues  are real. (because $\lam_i =
\av{\lam_i|M|\lam_i}\in\RR$)




If $M$ is Hermitian, then there exists
a matrix $C$ that is unitary  ($CC^\dagger = C^\dagger C =1$)
and diagonalizes $M$

\beq
CMC^\dagger=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\Lam_{\lam_1}
&0
&0
&0
\\
0
&\Lam_{\lam_2}
&0
&0
\\
0
&0
&\ddots
&0
\\
0
&0
&0
&\Lam_{\lam_r}
\end{array}
\right]
\eeq
where

\beq
\Lam_{\lam_i} =
\lam_i
\text{diag}\underbrace{(1,1, \dots,1)}_{d_i\text{ times}}=
\lam_i I^{d_i\times d_i}
\eeq
and

\beq
d=\sum_{i=1}^r d_i
\eeq
As in Chapter \ref{ch-clebsch-gordan},
let us set 

\beq
\pi_{i}  = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0
&0
&0
\\
0
&I^{d_i\times d_i}
&0
\\
0
&0
&0
\end{array}
\right]^{d\times d}
\eeq
and

\beq 
P_i = C^\dagger\pi_i C
\eeq


For example,
when $d=2$, 


\beq
CMC^\dagger =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\lam_1 &0
\\
0&\lam_2
\end{array}
\right]
\eeq
so

\beq
\pi_1=
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1&0
\\
0&0
\end{array}
\right]
=
\frac{CMC^\dagger -\lam_2}{\lam_1-\lam_2},
\quad
P_1 = \frac{M -\lam_2}{\lam_1-\lam_2}
\eeq

\beq
\pi_2 =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0&0
\\
0&1
\end{array}
\right]
=
\frac{CMC^\dagger-\lam_1}{\lam_2-\lam_1}
,\quad
P_2=
\frac{M-\lam_1}{\lam_2-\lam_1}
\eeq
$\{\pi_1, \pi_2\}$ is a 
complete
orthogonal set of projection operators,
and so is
$\{P_1, P_2\}$.


Similarly, for $d>2$, we have

\beq
\pi_i =
\prod_{j\neq i}
\frac{CMC^\dagger -\lam_j}{\lam_i -\lam_j},\quad
P_i =
\prod_{j\neq i}
\frac{M -\lam_j}{\lam_i -\lam_j}
\label{eq-pi-gen-formula}
\eeq
$\{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^r$ is
a complete set of 
orthogonal projection operators
and $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^r$ is too. 

Note that
\beq
d_i = \tr (\pi_i) = \tr(P_i)
\eeq


\section{$[P_i, M]=0$ Consequences}

From Eq.(\ref{eq-pi-gen-formula}), it is
clear that
$P_i$ and $M$
commute

\beq
[P_i, M]=
P_iM-MP_i=0
\eeq
From the $P_i$'s completeness and
commutativity with $M$, we get

\beqa
M&=& \sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^r
P_iM P_j
\\
&=&
\sum_{i=1}^r
P_iM P_i
\eeqa

\begin{claim}
For all $i$,
\beq
MP_i = \lam_i P_i \;
\text{(no $i$ sum)}
\eeq
\end{claim}
\proof

\beqa
MP_i&=&
[C^\dagger\Lam C] 
[C^\dagger \pi_i C]
\\
&=&
\lam_i [C^\dagger \pi_i C]
\\
&=&
\lam_i P_i
\eeqa
\qed


From the 
last claim, it immediately follows that if  $f(x)$ can be
expressed as a 
power series in
$x$, then
\footnote{$M$ must also satisfy
some
convergence conditions
that we won't get into.}

\beq
f(M) P_i = f(\lam_i)P_i \;
\text{(no $i$ sum)}
\eeq

\section{Multiple Invariant Matrices}
Suppose 
$M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}\in \CC^{d\times d}$
are Hermitian matrices that
commute

\beq
[M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}]  =0
\eeq
Use $M^{(1)}$ to decompose $V=\CC^{d\times d}$
into 
a direct sum of vector spaces $\bigoplus_i V_i$.
Then we can use  $M^{(2)}$ to decompose $V_i$ into
$\bigoplus_j V_{i,j}$. 
If $M^{(1)}$ and $M^{(2)}$ don't
commute, let $P^{(1)}_i$ be an eigenvalue 
projection operator of $M^{(1)}$. Then replace $M^{(2)}$ by $P^{(1)}_i M^{(2)}P_i^{(1)}$. Now

\beqa
[M^{(1)}, P^{(1)}_iM^{(2)}P^{(1)}_i]  
&=&
\sum_j\lam_j^{(1)}
[P_j^{(1)}, P_i^{(1)}M^{(2)}
P_i^{(1)}]
\\
&=&
0
\eeqa

\section{$[G, M]=0$  Consequences}

An invariant matrix (see Ch.\ref{ch-invariants}) commutes with 
all the elements $G$ of a group $\calg$

\beq
[G, M] =0
\eeq
If $P_i$ are 
the projection operators of $M$, then $P_i=f_i(M)$ so

\beq
[G, P_i]=0
\eeq
for all $G\in \calg$ and $i$.
Hence,

\beq
G = 1G1 =\sum_i\sum_j P_i G P_j
=
\sum_j \underbrace{P_j G P_j}_
{\eqdef G'_j}
\eeq


Since $P_i = C^\dagger  \pi_i C$,

\beq
[CGC^\dagger, \pi_i]=0
\eeq
Hence

\beq
CGC^\dagger =
1G1 =\sum_i\sum_j \pi_i CGC^\dagger \pi_j= \sum_j\underbrace{  \pi_j CGC^\dagger \pi_j}_
{\eqdef G_j}=diag(G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_r)
\eeq

Note that

\beq
C^\dagger G_j C = G_j'
\eeq


A rep-matrix $G'_i$ acts only
on a $d_i$ dimensional vector space $V^{d_i}=P_i V^d$.
In this way, an invariant
matrix $M\in \CC^{d\times d}$
with $r$ 
distinct eigenvalues,
induces a decomposition of $V^d$
into a direct sum of vector spaces

\beq
V^d\xymatrix{\ar[r]_M&}
V_1^{d_1}
\oplus 
V_2^{d_2}
\oplus
\ldots
\oplus 
V_r^{d_r}
\eeq
If a rep-matrix $G'_i$ cannot itself be
reduced further, it is said to 
be an {\bf irreducible representation (irrep)}.

Note that sometimes the term representation
is used to refer to the 
vector space $V_i^{d_i}$
instead of the matrix $G_i$.
