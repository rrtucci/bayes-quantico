\section{Lagrange's Theorem}

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite
group $G$ ($H\le G$)



$g H = \{gh| h\in H\}$ Left coset with coset representative $g$

$G:H=$ set of coset representatives

$G/H=\{gH| g\in G:H\}$


Form the Lagrange table with
rows labelled by $g\in G:H$ and columns
labelled by $h\in H$. Table entries equal to $gh$

\begin{claim}Every element of $G$ appears exactly once in the Lagrange Table. Therefore

\beq
|G:H| \; |H| = |G|
\eeq
\end{claim}
\proof

Given $x\in G$, calculate \beq
A_x=\{g=xh^{-1}|
h\in H\}\eeq
One of the elements
$g\in A_x$ must be in $G:H$. Hence $x=gh\in gH$.  So every $x\in G$ appears at least one coset.

Suppose $x$ appears in 2 cosets $g_1H$ and $g_2H$.
\beq
 g_1h_1=g_2h_2\eeq
so
\beq
g_2^{-1} g_1= h_2 h_1^{-1}\in H
\eeq
Hence, 
\beq
g_2^{-1} g_1 H = H\implies g_2H = g_1H
\eeq
\qed

A group $G$ is {\bf abelian} if $g_1 g_2=g_2 g_1$ for all $g_1,g_2\in  G$. 

$H$ is  {\bf normal}
subgroup of $G$ (i.e., $H\trianglelefteq G$)
iff $gH=Hg$ (i.e., $gGg^{-1}=H$)
for all $g\in G$.
All subgroups  $H$ of an abelian group $G$  are
normal subgroups.

$G$ gives all operations.

$H=$ symmetries for a given reference state

$G:H=$ all distinct reference states,
often called the {\bf index set}

$G/H=$ set of left cosets, often called a
{\bf quotient space or coset space}. Also called {\bf quotient group or coset group} if $H$ is a normal
subgroup

$
G=S_3 = \{e,\ (12),\ (13),\ (23),\ (123),\ (132)\}
$ The symmetric group on 3 letters,


$H = \{e,(12)\}$

Cosets

\beq\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
eH &= \{e,(12)\}
\\
(13)H &= \{(13),(123)\}
\\
(23)H &= \{(23),(132)\}
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq

$G:H =
\{e,\ (13),\ (23)\}$ coset representatives. 

\beq
|G|= 6, \quad |G:H|=3, \quad |H|=2
\eeq




$H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ ($H\) iff

In this example, $H$ is not a normal subgroup of $G$
because 
\beq
(13)H = \{(13),\underbrace{(13)(12)}
_{(123)}\}
\eeq

and

\beq
H(13)
=\{(13),\underbrace{(12)(13)}
_{(213)}\}
\eeq
are not equal.

\item


$G= Z_6=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$
 under addition mod 6.

$H=\{0,3\}$

$G$ is abelian so every subgroup of $G$ is normal

$G:H=\{0,1,2\}$, coset representatives

Cosets

\beq
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0+ H=\{0,3\}
\\
1+ H=\{1,4\}
\\
2+ H=\{2,5\}
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq

\hrule
\item ($H$ is normal subgroup even though $G$ is not abelian)

$S_3^e = \{e,(123),(132)\}$, even number of cycles

$S_3^o=\{(12),(13),(23)\}$, odd number of cycles

$G=S_3=S_3^o \cup S_3^e$



$
H = S_3^e.
$



$S_3^e \trianglelefteq S_3$ because $\s S_3^e =S_3^e \s =S_3^o$
for all $\s \in S_3$

$G:H=\{e, (12)\}$ coset representatives


Cosets

\beq
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
eH &= S_3^e
\\
(12)H&= S_3^o
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq

\beq
S_3 / S_3^e \cong  Z_2
\eeq
